# GraphQL and MongoDB boilerplate

1. Run the mongo script to populate data in the database (MongoDB will take care creating the db and the collection). Note: the database should be running on your local machine. Otherwise, make changes to config/mongodb.js

``` node config/loadData.js ```

2. Run the GraphQL server

``` nodemon ```
